v-for ="img in imaes"in v-for loop imagesar same as we usee in data images.
if we replace this with other name as well.
and in vif and in mounted as well we have to change it.
mounted function does it seees that html want to render sone images.
db.getImages().then(results => {
    console.log("results: ", results);
    res.json(results);
});
images are the image array and app.get take the image form there.
<div class="images-container"
    v-if="images.length"
v-on: is equal to @click in vue.
there is ot difference between single quote or double quote
in method we tell to the user dont refresh the page for upload the file. its a single page program.
