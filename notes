in part 3 we have to use one component
component are in vue is a short of mini vue instance.
it can be placed in other component.
its a reusable things in component
its a very well in react
browser are implimented in web component
in this we can create our own html tag
vue component are inspired by web component
there is couple of way to defined component
we have to use lower case to create a component
script.js
Vue.component('hello-world',{
template:'<code> helllo, world!!</code>'
// we use backslash for making more line its not working in single quotes.
});
and in html i can create our on tag like this
<hello-world inline-template>
<code> helllo, world!!</code> // but this thing we can use once.
</hello-world>
it wuld be better dont do inline-template and function should know what should we print

we can add method in  vue component
it is shot of like creatind constructor in vue.
we dont allow to give component in main
or in script.js
Vue.component('hello-world',{
template:'#hello-world-template'

data: function(){
return {
username:'kitty'
}
},
method:{
clicked:function(){
this.username:'world';
}
}
});
in html
<script id="hello-world-template" type="text/x-template">
<code @click="clicked"> hello, world!!</code>
</script>
in html for DATA
<script id="hello-world-template" type="text/x-template">
<code> helllo, {{username}}!!</code>
</script>

in this we have to use this outside the main and before the other script tag.
we can use may template in one template
like we have tomention all template inside the code template if we want to defind outside
 then we have to rap all stuff in div
<style="border" 1px red dashed margin : 40px padding: 10px>
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
we have create many component and call in main means in html page
lke today we create to js file helloworld.js and bye-bye.js
there we create a component and in html we have to mention js files in html
__________________________________________________
pros :- Data can be passed to components as custom attributes. This data is referred
to as props in Vue.js terminology. In order to pass a prop to a component,
you must declare the name for it by listing it in an array named props.
give the property name props who content arrays
props like data nd vue
html is case in senstive so camel case doesnt work. so we cant preserave the camel case.
try to make one worldinstance of using camel case or slash or kabab case that is with slash like big-sentence
we cant use camel case and kabab case too.
parents can control there children by passing that props but children cant do.
